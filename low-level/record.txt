Observation (obs):
    Joint positions, velocities
    Contact sensors or gait phase info
    Command targets (if --observe_gait_commands)
    Possibly noise from _get_noise_scale_vec()



Reward:
Tracks performance: velocity tracking, foot clearance, energy cost
Done condition: falls, too far from goal, etc.
